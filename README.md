# THIS IS A FORK OF THE FORK FOR ARCHIVE PURPOSES
# NOT MAINTAINED

The original code kept crashing Unity, revealed internal core bugs in Unity. I tried to get Unity corp to accept / fix these, but they refused, so ... I found a better library to work with.

Use Triangle.net, the open-source C# library that's higher performance with more features. It does delaunay and voronoi.

## Fork of Unity-Delaunay

This fork exists to add:

 - Issue-tracking (missing from master project)
 - More interactivity in the demo project / add missing docs to source code

I hate forking projects - big waste of time - but with no issue-tracking on upstream, I really had no choice.

## Current features

Upgrades compared to upstream:

 - NOW PACKAGED AS A SINGLE .DLL FILE YOU CAN DRAG/DROP INTO UNITY
 - Demo project lets you enable/disable rendering of individual features
  - Helps you understand the definitions (undocumented in source)
  - Helps you experiment with the data structures before embedding in your own projects
 - Usage instructions!

## Instructions

### Running the Demo
 - Open the "demo" folder in Unity as a new Project
 - Open the "Demo" scene inside Unity (otherwise nothing will happen when you run)
 - Select the "Extended demo" object
 - Click the "re-generate" button to make a new random Voronoi
 - in the Editor view you'll now see a coloured diagram of your data
 - also you now have tickboxes to show/hide various features of the output data

### Including in your own game/app

 1. In the CSharpLibrary folder, there should be a subfolder: AS3DelaunayExtended/AS3DelaunayExtended/bin/Debug
 1. ...which contains the DLL: AS3DelaunayExtended.dll
 1. Drag/drop that DLL into your Unity3D project, and Unity will automatically load + add it
 1. You can now use all the classes and features in your project
   1. NB: this DLL does NOT include the Custom Editor classes (Unity requires two DLLs if you want that)
   1. NB: this means you lose the custom buttons for "Re-generate Voronoi"; you can use the function via script/code only!


# Unity-Delaunay

Voronoi diagrams, Delaunay triangulation, minimum spanning graphs, convex hull and more. Ported to C# for use in the Unity game engine from https://github.com/nodename/as3delaunay.
